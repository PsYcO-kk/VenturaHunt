                    What do you see in the picture?<br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> A thermometer<br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> A tank<br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> A banner of SALE written on it<br/><br/><br/>
                    So how do we solve it?<br/><br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Let's try them all out in the answer box. It says wrong answer.<br/><br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Searching the 'thermometer tank sale' on google does not land us anywhere conclusive<br/><br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Let's take them two at a time. In this case googling for 'tanksale' lands us on some LinkedIn id and a wiki page of Shivani Tanksale, a well-known face on TV serials and movies. Trying both them out also gives us wrong answer.<br/><br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Looking for hints we go on to check the page source where we find a comment - "seek for a 'consort'". Googling the whole thing doesn't do us any good but just consort lands you with the meaning of the word - wife, husband or companion.<br/><br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> We search for the partners of both of the personalities we found above. Luckily we find out that spouse of Shivani Tanksale is Sumeet Vyas, a famous actor from the exciting series 'Permanent Roommates' and 'Tripling' by TVF.  We know we are on the right track as even TVF's logo also has a thermometer in it. We try each one of the out.<br/> <br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Finally writing 'theviralfever' in the answer box gives us the correct answer message<br/><br/>
                    In case you think that above mentioned steps are too complicated and illusive. You will be getting a number of hints for questions to guide you on the right track. Have fun hunting!!!<br/><br/>
